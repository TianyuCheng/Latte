TODO LIST:
----------


- test sgemm\_axpy in Latte.cpp (code provided)

- write load\_train\_feature(int data\_index) in Latte.h and generate code
  for this part 

- parse annotate() for LossNeuron

- test the existing pattern matching and code generation framework with mlp.py

- develop more felexible and scalable framework of pattern matching

- loop tiling pass 

- loop fusion pass


Usage
-----

To generate code for given latte script, please run

    python generator.py [latte_script(.py)] [out_cpp_file(.cpp)]

Please put the generated cpp file "[out\_cpp\_file(.cpp)]" together with "Latte.h". 

To compile the generated code, enter the root of codebases (where you should place "Latte.h" and generated "[out\_cpp\_file(.cpp)]"), and run

    make 
    
Please make sure you have installed MKL library correctly and compile the generated cpp code using flags provided in the MKL compiling advisor. 



Assumptions
-----

- Assume only one data layer and loss layer in each network

- Assume Function name for data layer must contain "DataLayer"

- Assume Function name for loss layer must contain "LossLayer"
